# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

* Add a test suite for VectorQuantizer.
* Add 'vectors' fixtures in a dedicated conftest.py to provide some common data input, with or without channel first.
* Remove the 'test_readme.py' file, as it is definitely not useful. Will be replaced in the future by the pytest-examples plugin.
